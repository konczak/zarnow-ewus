# Manuals

Manuals are written for end user. Easiest way to write a good-looking manual is to follow Markdown format. GitHub markdown does not allow export rendered
version of markdown.

To get an HTML version of manual use [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/). Copy-paste content and export as styled HTML.
